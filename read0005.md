SearchBar
ProductTable
ProductCategoryRow
ProductRow

What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
Answer: a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into
smaller subcomponents.

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
Answer: State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it

Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
Answer: adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.

What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
Answer: Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

How can you identify where state needs to live?
Answer: decided that our state lives in FilterableProductTable. First, add an instance property this.state =
{filterText: '', inStockOnly: false} to FilterableProductTable’s constructor to reflect the initial state
of your application. Then, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as a prop.
Finally, use these props to filter the rows in ProductTable and set the values of the form fields in SearchBar.
