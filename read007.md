## Table

*Basic Table Structure*

*The open `` <table> ``and closing at the end `` </table>`` element is used
to create a table* in JS! 

 example to creat table :

 ```
<table>
 <tr>
 <td>0</td>
 <td>7</td>
 <td>9</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>1</td>
 <td>5</td>
 <td>0</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>14</td>
 <td>1</td>
 <td>5</td>
 </tr>
</table>
 ```

will appear like : 
  
```
    079
    150
    1415
```
>  Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the` <td>` element (or` <th>` if it is a
header)


> For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
`<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`. 



### Border & Background


*The border attribute was used
on both the`` <table>`` and`` <td>``
elements to indicate the width of
the border in pixels.*

## methods and functions

> JavaScript methods are the actions that can be performed on objects.

> A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.


> Methods are functions stored as object properties.


- You access an object method with the following syntax:

`` objectName.methodName()``

> An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can be converted to a string, including the empty string. 



- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
