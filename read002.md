## HTML has six "levels" of 
headings:

```
<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>

```
- h1 is used for main headings.
- h2 is used for subheadings.

> If there are further sections 'h3' you can use also as subheadings!

 * HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).


*  They also provide semantic information

**CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements**
 
 *CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two 
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify 
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon*

*example*

```
h1, h2, h3 {
          font-family: Arial;
            color: yellow;}

```

- This rule indicates that all `<h1>`, 
`<h2>` and `<h3>` elements 
should be shown in the Arial 
typeface, in a yellow color

- Properties (font-family)indicate the aspects 
of the element you want to 
change. For example, color, font, 
width, height and border.

- Values(arial,yellow) specify the settings 
you want to use for the chosen 
properties. For example, if you 
want to specify a color property 
then the value is the color you 
want the text in these elements 
to be.


> CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.

> CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page


## STATEMENTS 

**A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.** 

*COMMENTS* : They help make your code easier to read and understand!

|Data types  |   Example    |

|NUMERIC DATA|0.75 |
|STRING DATA |'Hi'|
|BOOLEAN DATA| True or False|

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe. 

- variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
