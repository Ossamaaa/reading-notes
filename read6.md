***Color***

*The color property allows you*
to specify the color of text inside
an element. 

*three ways* you can specify any
color in CSS :

- rgb values : These express colors in terms
of how much ,For example: rgb(100,100,90)
 
- hex codes :These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of color prewceded by a hash # sign , for example #ee3e80
 
- color names : There are 147 predefined colornames that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

*Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.*

*ways to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values:*

Hue: is the colloquial idea of
color. In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle

Saturation: is the amount of
gray in a color. Saturation is
represented as a percentage.
100% 

Lightness is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color. Lightness
is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100%
lightness is white, and 50%
lightness is normal. Lightness
is sometimes referred to as
luminosity.
