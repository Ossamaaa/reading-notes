*you might want to add
a link from part way down the
page back to the top of it to save
users from having to scroll back
to the top!*

**Before you can link to a specific
part of a page, you need to
identify the points in the page
that the link will go to. You do
this using the id attribute**

*The value of the id attribute
should start with a letter or an
underscore (not a number or
any other character) and, on a
single page, no two id attributes
should have the same value.*

```
-Links are created using the <a> element.

-The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

-If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs

-You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.

-You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.
