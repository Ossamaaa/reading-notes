How does pair programming work? The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the
“mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course
writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to
the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be
converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
