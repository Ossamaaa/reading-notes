*there are two types of expressions :*


1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE (In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value) 

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE(You can perform operations on any number of individual values) 

3. Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.
