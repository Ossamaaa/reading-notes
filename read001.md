 *is made up of characters that live inside angled 
brackets â€” these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually 
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag.*

- The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.
```

left-angle bracket   <

RIGHT-angle bracket >

Forward Slash      /
```

* anything between left and right bracket called Character
as <  p >

*example:*
```
<h> <\h1>

```

-  we can used tags act like containers

- we can use the last example like are a main heading.



>Attributes provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
separated by an equals sign.

 + Attributes require a name and a value.


*HTML pages are text documents*

**To learn HTML you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go**

> Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements.

> To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
which is available free from Google.


> You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you present.

 > It's important to understand who your target audience 
is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return
