Markdown it is very important in HTML, it's have two thing  , first one: a plain text formatting syntax and a software tool ,,
on other word we can saying the main goal for Markdown ,,
 github (Links to an external site.) uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features as well as it's easier to use ,,

some of features get my attention like making a table and  mentions by username same way in social media.
