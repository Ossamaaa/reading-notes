*first of all*
 the Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.

**simple explain :**
```
The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.
```

**Quite simply**, 
*HTML* (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create the actual content of the page, such as written text, 

*CSS* (Cascade Styling Sheets) is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background color.

**There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the
left and right angled brackets**


There are also special codes
that can be used to show
symbols such as copyright and
trademark, currency symbols,
mathematical characters, and
some punctuation marks
