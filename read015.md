*The purpose of creating teams is to provide a framework that will increase the ability of employees to participate in
planning, problem-solving, and decision-making to better serve customers. Increased participation promotes:*

- A better understanding of decisions
- More support for and participation in implementation plans
- Increased contribution to problem-solving and decision making
- More ownership of decisions, processes, and changes
- More ability and willingness to participate in performance evaluation and improvement

> Organising and Planning Skills Being organised is essential to getting tasks done.

*If you don’t know what needs to be done, and by when, it’s quite hard to make it happen by your deadline. Shapers,
Implementers and Completer-Finishers are all characterised by good organising skills, and can usually be relied upon
to put in place strong systems for managing projects well.*

Problem-Solving Task-focused people are often adept at problem-solving, especially if the problem relates to the task.

Plants look for innovative ideas to solve the problem, and Implementers will turn ideas into practical action.

Shapers will see the ‘big picture’ and the overall plan, making sure that the solution to the problem does not result in a change of direction

Feedback Skills Giving and receiving feedback well is essential in any team-working situation. Being able to give clear and effective feedback to others is vital
to keep the group process running effectively, and to plan. It also helps to ensure that you do not get irritated and angry with the way that
others are behaving. It follows that you also need to be able to receive feedback gracefully, and then act on it calmly.
