***Comparison Oprearators***

**You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in script to what you expect it might be " the result will be a Boolean as True or false!** 

*Example on  :* 

==  is equal to 

!= is not equal to

!==  Strict not equal to

=== Strict equal to 

&& Logical and 

|| logical or 

! logical not

-On strict must have the same data type and same value !

 In any condition there is usually one operator and two operands . 

 *The operands* are placed on each side of operator" they can be values or variables.

also , it is not necessary have a single value or variable name , Can be an expression !


*short- circuit evaluation :*

```
false && Anything

it has found :false 

true || any thing 
it has found  :true 
```
**Loops:Check a condition if it returns true a code block will run .it reapts until the condition returns "false".**

*Three types of loops* :

 
*For : if you need to run code a specific times use  it .

*While : if you don't know how many times the code should run!

*Do-while : very similar to the While , but tthe diffrent is : it will always run the statments at least once even if condition is False !

 *Some explanation:* 
```
var i =0;  creat a variable and set it 0 .

i<10; the loop countinue run until reaches 10 

i++  every time the loop has run adds one to the counter!


```
